Place your data sets and data bases in this folder.
The folder content is deliberately ignored by git.

Please, follow the following conventions
- Use a subfolder in lowercase for each sample. Examples: "georgefloyd" or "microcefalia".
- In each sample folder, create an "images" folder that contains the images.
- When you process the images, for example to generate thumbnails or extract bounding boxes, 
  store results in dedicated sub folders next to the "images" folder.  
- Metadata for the images may be stored in CSV or JSON files directly in the sample folder.
- Stick to lowercase file names without whitespace and special characters.
