# Web Apps

This folder hosts simple web apps. No server needed. The apps run with JavaScript in the browser.

## GetImg

[ðŸ‘‰ Open GetImg](https://datavana.github.io/graphim/getimg/)

Prepare a csv file with image URLs in one of the columns.
The app will download the images, add one column for the filename and one with a thumbnail, encoded as data url.
The resulting images and the csv file will be packaged as zip file.


## Image2URL

[ðŸ‘‰ Open Image2URL](https://datavana.github.io/graphim/img2url)
 
Convert images in a folder to data URLs. 
Conversion is done using JavaScript locally running in the browser.

The app skeleton was generated by the following ChatGPT prompts:

1. Can I process all files of a local folder in a webpage using javascript (running in the browser), create thumbnails and base64 encode them?
2. Add html structure.
3. Now, only show the first 40 thumbs. But create a csv file with filename in first col and data url in second. Provide csv file download once finished.

**TODOs**:
- Find a better name for the tool?
- Refine user interface, make it beautiful.
- Add explanations how to use it directly on the page.
- Refactor JavaScript code: Implement a class.
